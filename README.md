This Python plugin for the [Cheshire Cat framework](https://github.com/cheshire-cat-ai/core) suggests related questions based on user input. If the user's sentence ends with a question mark ("?"), it becomes the subject for generating three related questions, which are then appended to the Cat's answer.
